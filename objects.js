// We are going to complete a function that takes no parameters,
// and returns a newly created object. Your function should create a
// variable and assign it to a new object, then return that variable.
//  Below is an example of the code running, assuming that you will have
//  completed the described function: createObject
function createObject() {
	// create a result variable,
	let result;
	// assign it to a new object
	result = {};
	// return the result variable
	return result;
}
